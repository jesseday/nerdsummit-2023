## Raw notes

- speaker: Sage Orville Shea
- Sign language glove
	- who designed it (hearing person)
	- puts the onus on the person using sign language
- handicap primarily not used b/c disabled communities didn't pick it for themselves
	- disabled tends to be preferred these days b/c it acknowledges the identity.
	- people-first vs identity first language
		- people first was in vogue for a long time
		- disabled communities are more often now preferring to acknowledge the disability (identity) first
- Models of disability
	- where does disability lie
		- body and mind or how the world around us is designed
	- medical model of disability
    - problematic model
		- dominant model in society now
		- a problem that is located in the individual and is a deficiency or abnormality
		- primarily refers to the relationship of power and how gets to wield the definition
		- where does it come from
			- starts with the rise of statistics which now create standard and nonstandard subpopulations.  creates new categories of people
			- eugenics: science of "hereditity" has disastrous consequences for marginalized groups
			- Ogive - the cumulative frequency and shows "sub" populations
			- capitalism - industrial revolution needs bodies to be interchangable in order for assembly line work to "work"
	- Social Model of disability
		- **people are disabled because the world is not built for them**
		- Barriers
			- physical: buildings not having accessible toilets
			- social: attitudes like assuming disabled people can't do certain things or unwillingness to accommodate
		- example:
			- glasses wearers would be considered disabled in the past but now the world accomodates
		- 75% of legally blind people aren't working
		- disability and ability are shaped by design
	- Disabled design
		- Liz Jackson - honoring the friction of disability
			- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZhiu-jGbdE
		- Example: Curb cuts - wheelchair accessible sidewalks were fought for by disabled people
		- others:
			- Touchscreens
			- Audiobooks
			- Text-to-speech
			- Hearing aids (one of the earliest reasons for miniaturaization)
		- Gallaudet design "DeafSpace"

	- **Design with, not for**
		- paid and valuable, not just user tester
	- Goals must be specific, with determined metrics
	- One size fits one, not one size fits all
	- make the co-design process accessible
		- are meetings offered in hybrid
		- is the physical office and the route to get there accessible
		- are materials sent over in accessible ways
		- is there enough time to engage
	- Disability "dongles"
		- avoid them
		- well intended, elegant, useless
		- generally created by able bodied people
		- often cost prohibitive
