# Talk: Listening as Leadership


## Key Takeaways

- Important to note that this was called "Listening as leadership", but I think it could have
  been renamed, "Inclusive Leadership" or something like that.
- Really it was around how we ensure everyone in our team or org has a seat at the table.
- There is nothing about these practices that are strictly for management teams.  These are for anyone,
  and as your role in an organization changes, you may end up with more eyes on your actions and these
  become more important.


## Raw Notes

- Having a plan and aligning on why you are doing something is an inclusive practice
  because it allows everyone to participate to the fullest of their abilities.
- Quantum Learning Tenets
  - Everything you do speaks
    - be deliberate and proactive
    - as a leader, everyone is watching you.  what you say, how you say it, and what you don't say have a huge impact
    - build in routines and predictability.  set your team up for success
    - clarity is key
  - Everything is on purpose
  - Experience before label
  - Acknowledge every effort
    - effort is a choice.  to build self-efficacy within teams, we have to celebrate that
  - If it's worth learning, it's worth celebrating
